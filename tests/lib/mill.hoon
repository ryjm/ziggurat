::  Tests for lib/zig/mill.hoon
::  Basic goal: construct a simple granary / helix state
::  and manipulate it with some calls to our zigs contract.
::  Mill should handle clearing a mempool populated by
::  calls and return an updated granary. The zigs contract
::  should manage transactions properly so this is testing
::  the arms of that contract as well.
